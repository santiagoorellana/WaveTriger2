<H1>Wave Trigger 2.0</H1>

This tool allows you to record the audio that is captured with the PC's sound card in a WAV file. The capture can be done up to 44100 samples per second and with a resolution of up to 16 bits. The audio files are saved with a name made up of the date and time the recording started, as follows: Year-Month-Day_Hour-Minute-Second. Audio signals in the range of 0 to 22 Khz can be recorded.

The folder in which the files are saved can be selected by the user. Recording can be done in the following ways:

<H3>Manually</H3>
The user starts and stops the recording at will.

<H3>By threshold crossing</H3>
The user establishes a threshold that, when exceeded by the spectrum, starts the recording process automatically.
It can be done with two types of thresholds, which are: 
<br><br>
<b>Linear Threshold </b>

The recording inertia parameter allows adjusting the delay between the disappearance of the audio signal being recorded and the end of the recording.

When the audio signal saturates the computer's audio card input, the program displays a visual alert to tell the user what has happened. The user must then decrease the audio gain (Volume) on the input.
